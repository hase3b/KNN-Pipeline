# KNN-Pipeline
This repository contains an implementation of a comprehensive machine-learning pipeline tailored for classification tasks. The pipeline encompasses various stages including data collection, cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, manual data splitting, cross-validation, model selection, training, and evaluation.

This repository contains Python scripts for the pipeline's support and master functions along with the pipeline's execution on the following 5 datasets in separate Jupyter Notebooks. Compiled results are included in this repository, and posted separately.
